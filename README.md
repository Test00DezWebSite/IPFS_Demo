# Coding Challenge - Due Date, Thursday, October 12 2017 at 12 PM PST

This weeks challenge is to create and upload your own simple web app to IPFS. It can be anything (an image uploading service, a personal blog, a game, etc.). Post your github link in the comments section, bonus points if you upload a dynamic web app, (which means you'll have to use [IPNS](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNZiPk974vDsPmQii3YbrMKfi12KTSNM7XMiYyiea4VYZ/example#/ipfs/QmP8WUPq2braGQ8iZjJ6w9di6mzgoTWyRLayrMRjjDoyGr/websites/README.md). Good luck!

## Overview 

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/BA2rHlbB5i0) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval on The Interplanetary File System. This code is a simple JS video player that demonstrates how you can upload simple web apps to IPFS. 

## Dependencies

* IPFS (https://ipfs.io/docs/getting-started/)

## Usage

First, install IPFS using [this](https://ipfs.io/docs/getting-started/) page. 

Then, once you've initalized IPFS and started the daemon see [this](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNZiPk974vDsPmQii3YbrMKfi12KTSNM7XMiYyiea4VYZ/example#/ipfs/QmP8WUPq2braGQ8iZjJ6w9di6mzgoTWyRLayrMRjjDoyGr/websites/README.md) page on how to add this static video player web app to IPFS

## Credits 

Credits for this code go to [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
